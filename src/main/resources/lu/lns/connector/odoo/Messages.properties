odoo.connector.display=Odoo Connector
odoo.config.group.basic=Basic
odoo.config.url=Odoo URL
odoo.config.url.help=The address of Odoo, e.g. http://localhost:10082 if deployed locally on port 10082
odoo.config.database=Database
odoo.config.database.help=The Odoo database to access
odoo.config.username=User name
odoo.config.username.help=The user name to authenticate with
odoo.config.password=User password or API key
odoo.config.password.help=The password or API key to authenticate with
odoo.config.group.schema=Schema
odoo.config.models.retrieve=Retrieve models
odoo.config.models.retrieve.help=Optionally defines which Odoo models will be retrieved for schema. Default is to retrieve all models. Format: comma-separated list of model names, supporting the asterisk at the end of model name to includes models starting with that name. Example (without quotes): "model1, hr.employee*, res.*"
odoo.config.models.expand=Expand relations
odoo.config.models.expand.help=Optionally defines which Odoo model's many2one relations will be expanded, i.e. the fields of those related models can be accessed as part of the original model. Example: Specifying "res.users--partner_id" will allow to read and write attribute "partner_id--phone" in model "res.users". This way closely related records can be handled as one record. If this configuration is not specified then no model field will be expanded (default). Format: comma-separated list of field paths, supporting the asterisk at the end to include paths starting with that name. Example: "res.users--*, hr.employee--any_relation_id". Please note: Only one level of expansion is supported. And using expanded relations might cause trouble regarding data consistence because multiple API operations may be performed in a single connector create/update operation (Odoo API doesn't support transactions).
odoo.config.models.livesync=Models that will have live sync enabled
odoo.config.models.livesync.help=Optionally defines which Odoo models will have live sync enabled.
